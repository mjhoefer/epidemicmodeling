# Toward a Multi-Level Simulation Approach to Modeling Epidemics in Localities

This repository includes code for the paper titled "Toward a Multi-Level Simulation Approach to Modeling Epidemics in Localities."

test_model.py is the only code file needed to run the simulation.  If you'd like to use existing Summit County, Utah Census data, then download the CSV files as well.

Otherwise, enter the county and state of your choice to run the model.  Model parameters are changeable in-code, and they are generally commented as to their location and purpose.
